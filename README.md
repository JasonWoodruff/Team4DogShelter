===============
Documentation should look like the following for each function
```javascript
/*
@pre    - what the function expects to receive (data)
@param  - the parameters of the function
@post   - what happens to the data after the function executes
@return - what is returned, if anything
*/
```

Blocks of Code to Document **(explain what the code is doing)**
```javascript
Jason - Menu functions and user input validation
Stacy - Dog.h and Dog.cpp
Bryson - File I/O, including the File I/O function inside of HashMap.h.
Kevin - Tree.h and Tree.cpp
James - HashMap.h and HashMap.cpp.  
        Please also do the addDog() and displayEfficiencyReport() functions you wrote too.
```
